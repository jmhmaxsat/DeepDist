# DeepDist

This repository contains the implementation of the DeepDist algorithm for (Weighted) Partial MaxSAT, as proposed in our paper:

Enhancing Local Search for MaxSAT with Deep Differentiation Clause Weighting

## Usage Guide

To install and compile DeepDist on a Unix/Linux machine, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jmhmaxsat/DeepDist.git  
cd DeepDist
make
```
 
After compilation, an executable file named DeepDist will be available in the DeepDist directory.
To run the algorithm, use the following command: `./starexec_run-runsolver.sh instance_name`.
